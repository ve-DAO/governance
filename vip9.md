#### Simple Summary

Add community member '2x' to veDAO multisig with a 4/6 requirement.

#### Motivation & Rationale

In discussions for VIP-8, the team raised concern regarding the responsiveness of the current multisig setup, proposing a change in signers to incorporate only team members. This was met with some community feedback that resulted in a material change to VIP-8, retaining outside signers. 

Current signers for the multisig are @gabagool, @nickbtts, @homura, the Spiritswap team and FTMalerts with a 4/5 requirement. Recent transactions have taken up to 24hrs to execute, due to availability of outside signers and their understandable other commitments.

#### Specification

We have worked closely with a number of community members in recent weeks, who have provided valuable expertise, advice, feedback and constructive criticism as we have forged our future path forward. @2x has been instrumental in helping model Solidly and Solidex, and has a similar reputation in other DeFi communities. 

The team believe it is important to have community representation, and thus propose 2x be added as a multisig signer on a 4/6 basis, ensuring all transactions continue to have oversight from a signer outside of the team.
