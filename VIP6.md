### Simple Summary

Proposal to reduce 'pool 2' emissions by 76%, and retain until Solidly emissions begin, or MasterChef rewards end (whichever is first).

### Motivation & Rationale

Emittance is high for pool2, as parameters remain from the initial farming method. There are currently 53,008,941 tokens a week being generated by this pool meaning that total dilution is relatively high.

### Specification

The proposal is to reduce emissions on the WeVE-USDC pool by 76%, resulting in 12,722,145 tokens to be emitted per week. A total distribution breakdown is dependent on Soldily launch date and emissions start, but this will reduce the overall total number of tokens that reach circulation.

This will be enacted by the multisig through updates to MasterChef contract on vote passing.

Please note that there is a hardcoded end date for ALL emissions: https://ftmscan.com/block/countdown/31208000

With pool 2 reduction. These are not exact due to FTMScan circulating update and user pending rewards.

Total circulating: **423,785,029**  
Percentages:  
Community: **69.1%**  
Team: **9.7%**  
Eco: **21.2%**
