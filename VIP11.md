#### Simple Summary

Partner with Olympus Pro to offer WeVE bonds, in order for the treasury to acquire liquidity (WeVE><USDC), SEX and SOLID tokens.

#### Motivation & Rationale

Bonds allow the treasury to exchange WeVE for other assets without market selling. This proposal suggests that the DAO offer bonds for the purposes of acquiring

* **LP tokens**. This will allow a base floor of liquidity and also allow the treasury to potentially earn from gauge emissions and fees. 
* **SEX tokens.** SEX is the native voting token of Solidex, controlling underlying SOLID. Additional SEX will allow veDAO to direct further emissions and compound faster.
* **SOLID tokens.** SOLID can be votelocked and then used to vote, or exchanged for top layer tokens such SOLIDsex or oxSOLID.

#### Specification

##### Bond Amounts

* Total of 20% of ecosystem fund allocated to bonds - 18,776,754 WeVE.
* 14,000,000 WeVE allocated to WeVE<>USDC bonds.
* 3,000,000 WeVE allocated to SEX bonds.
* 1,776,754 WeVE allocated to SOLID bonds.

##### Implementation

Tech will be provided by [Olympus Pro](https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro). This will attract a 3.3% fee.
